I'm going to show you how I pretty much start every project I do. There are certain tools that help me be productive immediately so I'm pretty keen on getting those up-and ready as soon as possible.</p>\n<p>Some people will do more coding up front, but I like to have the \"scaffolding\" of my infrastructure up as soon as I can. When I say scaffolding, I mean the build process, code formatting, linting, testing, and type checking.</p>\n<p>Let's start by getting our first \"Hello World\" for the project up and running.</p>\n<p>You'll also need some images and a bit of CSS for me (I didn't want to dwell too much time on CSS so I wrote a bit of it for you.) You can get that <a href=\"https://github.com/btholt/project-files-for-fox-game\">here</a>. This repo has the various steps in the project. You'll want to start with the aptly-named <a href=\"https://github.com/btholt/project-files-for-fox-game/tree/master/start-here\">start-here</a> directory which has a <code class=\"language-text\">src</code> directory in it with the files you'll need.</p>\n<p>It's as simple as running <code class=\"language-text\">git clone https://github.com/btholt/project-files-for-fox-game.git</code>.</p>\n<p>You'll notice there are many folders in here. These are the various steps you'll hit along the way. I'll be sure to let you know when we've arrived at the next milestone so if you need help you glance at the next milestone.</p>\n<p>Make a new directory for your project and copy in that <code class=\"language-text\">src</code> folder from <code class=\"language-text\">start-here</code> (or just work in the start-here directory, that works too), run <code class=\"language-text\">npm init</code> in that folder. Feel free to answer those questions however you want (or run <code class=\"language-text\">npm init -y</code> to skip them.) This will start a new project with a <code class=\"language-text\">package.json</code> for you. This will allow you to <code class=\"language-text\">npm install</code> new packages and it'll save those to package.json so you can keep track of your dependencies.</p>\n<h2 id=\"git\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#git\" aria-label=\"git permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Git</h2>\n<p>I track everything in git, even if it doesn't make it up to GitHub.
